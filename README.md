local_manifest
==============

local_manifest for CM11.0 u8800pro compiling.
This is still a work in progress. Not ready for normal use.

Using these: "frameworks/av; frameworks/native; /hardware/libhardware_legacy" might not compile correctly. These need fixing. Not using these will cause broken WiFi and other problems. If compiling fails, use stock Cyanogenmod av, native, libhardware_legacy folders.

Big thanks to herna, szezso, Ivan, desalesouche, SpaceKiller and many many others that I forgot to mention. Without these people we wouldn't have KitKat on this device!
